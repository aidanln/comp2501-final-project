# Celestial Onslaught

### By Aidan Lalonde-Novales and Zander Azevedo

#### Created as a final project submission for COMP2501 at CU.

Top down view game set in space with wave-based survival gameplay and mechanics. The player controls a spaceship and fights off enemy spaceships to survive, and must upgrade equipment and develop strategies to fend off the increasingly difficult hordes. Focuses on action/sci-fi oriented gameplay and theming, such as futuristic weapon upgrades and fast-paced gameplay.
